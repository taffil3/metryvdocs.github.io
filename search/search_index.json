We\u2019re focused on solving problems regarding the most vital metrics for better User Experience. By giving the best experience to your users, you get to keep them longer on the site, as a result of which you get more engagement from them, more scrolling, better conversions, and all this meaning more profit. What does Good User Experience mean? Google has defined three core aspects of user experience as vital for web pages. You may know them as Core Web Vitals, which measure loading time of the page, interactivity and also visual stability. Let\u2019s focus for a second on loading time. There is a research done by the All in one SEO tool team, where they found that 40% of users abandon a web page if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. That means that if you have a page that loads very slow, you\u2019re probably loosing 40% of your potential clients. It affects the users psychologically by waiting too long that maybe your website is not worth it, they will get bored and just leave the site, even if you have the best SEO campaigns in the world. Another thing that needs to be considered too is that in the past two years Google has also started taking into calculation these metrics in their ranking algorithm as well. And that percentage will get higher with time. Now we offer a tool for all of these metrics. With MetryV you can add a site easily by just adding the page url. Monitor web vitals with daily and monthly graphs. Have notifications for metric alerts for Email, Slack or Discord, also you can choose which types of notifications you want. Other cool features like Server Uptime monitoring, w3 validator tool scans and Screenshot Analysis, which takes screenshots hourly of your website to check if there are any significant differences that you need to be worried about.
